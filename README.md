## SPARC backend stack

In the context of the [SPARC](http://beestar.eu) project, there are a number of technologies that we are using. Even though I am not developing on a regular basis, it is still useful for me to hack stuff here and there from time to time.

Some quick infos about the underlined tech stack follow
* [SPARC](SPARC/README.md) contains generic info about the project
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is the webserver and `NIO` framework powering the backend
* [Handlebar](SPARC/handlebars.md) is the template engine we use
* [Restify](SPARC/restify.md) is the `REST API` engine

## VIM as an IDE

VIM is quite mindtwisting and I feel there are very few people that truly master that editor. Nonetheless, its versatility and power do not cease to amaze me.

A collection of miscellaneous information and problems I stumble upon can be found under [Vim howtos](Vim/README.md)

## Some Other random stuff

Since I love technologies in general, and python in particular, sometimes I will explore some other tech-stacks unrelated to my daily job
