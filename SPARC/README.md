# What is SPARC

SPARC is the first *vehicle specific smart-device* for delivering connected-car services B2B.

SPARC is the only smart-device in the IoT ecosystem specifically conceived to eliminate the barriers to entry into the connected-car market B2B because it:

* universally integrates with any vehicle, car or truck without any installation needed;
* costs less than any other device on the market;
* is operated directly without any smartphone needed and in a safe way for the drivers;
* can be programmed directly or through server side APIs;
* offers connectivity out-of-the-box;
* can interoperate with other devices through `Bluetooth`, `NFC` or `USB`
* can be shared amongst multiple drivers without any issue of privacy or ownership
* includes a unique suite of E2E features immediately useful to drivers and fleet owners

Apart from the device's embedded technology, the SPARC comes with a unique set of features specific to drivers. These features are provided through a backend powered by `Node.js`. 

Technology used:
* [javascript](js.md) as programming language
* [node.js](nodejs.md) as webserver
* [Handlebar](handlebars.md) for templating
* [Restify](restify.md) for APIs
